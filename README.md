See the [road map](https://github.com/erkal/kite/projects/1).

[Here is a short video](https://youtu.be/LeTDfFwZv3s) showing the basic usage in an old version of Kite.

[Here is another short video](https://youtu.be/b4sfzHJeHsI) showing how to use Kite to visualize the module dependency graph of your Elm projects.

Kite is entirely written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

There is also an Elm Town episode about the story behind Kite, in case you are interested: [Elm Town 42 â€“ It's Just Darth Vader](https://elm.town/episodes/its-just-darth-vader)
